# Documentation
Documentation will be updated soon until the development has done.\
This repo will be integrated with [user-service-graphql](https://github.com/vincen320/user-service-graphql) repository.\
\
This is a new product-service-graphql repository that will use another depedency for graphql.\
This repository cloned from [product-service-graphql](https://github.com/vincen320/product-service-graphql), will do the same thing but some adjustment on dependency.\
New GraphQL Depedency used: [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go).\
Using **@master** tag version, because it has support separate resolvers for different operations even it's still not stable release yet.
